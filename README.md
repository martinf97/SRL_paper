# SRL_paper
This repository contains the julia files and jupyter notebooks
used to calculate the data for the scientific paper 
"Threshold studies for a hot beam superradiant laser 
including an atomic guiding potential"

Moreover it contains the data produced and some files
to read out and plot the data:

The files with filenames ending with _calc will calculate
and store the data.
The files with filenames ending with _plot will plot the
figures in the papers.

For mixed order and second order there is an example of
the code provided, named "mixed_order_example.jl" and
"second_order_example.ipynb".

The files were written and executed in julia 1.5.2.
